## ⚙️ Configuration

### Discord Rich Presence

The application includes Discord Rich Presence support. To customize it:

1. Create a Discord application at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Get your Application ID
3. Update the `client_id` in `main.pyw` (line 24):
   ```python
   def __init__(self, client_id="YOUR_APPLICATION_ID"):
   ```

### Token Detection

The application automatically detects Discord tokens from:
- Discord (stable)
- Discord Canary
- Discord PTB

If automatic detection fails, you can manually enter your token in the login window.

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **Local Only** - All operations run locally on your computer
- **No Data Collection** - The application doesn't collect or transmit any data
- **Token Security** - Your token is only used for API calls and never stored
- **Message Safety** - Only your own messages are deleted, never others' messages

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Irreversible Action** - Deleted messages cannot be recovered
- **Rate Limits** - The application respects Discord's rate limits automatically
- **System Messages** - System messages (calls, polls, etc.) are automatically skipped
- **Token Safety** - Never share your Discord token with anyone
- **Backup Recommended** - Consider backing up important messages before bulk deletion

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Token Not Found
- Make sure Discord desktop app is installed and you're logged in
- Try restarting Discord
- Manually enter your token in the login window

### Rate Limit Errors
- The application handles rate limits automatically
- If you see rate limit messages, wait for the automatic retry
- Consider deleting in smaller batches

### Application Won't Start
- Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.8+)
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip list`
- Check for error messages in the console

### GUI Not Displaying
- Ensure PyQt6 is installed: `pip install PyQt6`
- Try running with administrator privileges
- Check Windows display settings
